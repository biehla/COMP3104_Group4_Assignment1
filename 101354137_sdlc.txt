Importance of DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle
DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations.
It ensures faster delivery and better software quality.

- Collaboration: DevOps fosters better communication between development and operations teams.
- Automation: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automate the software release process.
- Infrastructure as Code: IaC allows infrastructure to be provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques.
