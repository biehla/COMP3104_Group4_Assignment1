Importance of DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle
DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations.
It ensures faster delivery and better software quality.

- Collaboration: DevOps fosters better communication between development and operations teams.
- Automation: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automate the software release process.
- Infrastructure as Code: IaC allows infrastructure to be provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques.

Incorporating DevOps into the SDLC can transform the software development process, making it more agile, efficient, and responsive to user needs.
